To Run Application:

Via Eclipse:: Run it directly, in that case default profile will be used. In case you want a different profile to be used, 
create a Run configuration for you main class, specifying the profile. To do that from toolbar, select Run->Run Configurations->Arguments->VM Arguments. Add -Dspring.profiles.active=local or -Dspring.profiles.active=prod]

Please take special note of two ‘-’ in front of spring.profiles.active. In the blog it might be appearing as single ‘-’ but there are in fact two ‘-’ of them.
